# Open issues/questions that will need to be addressed
#
# 0. Please note that this is not at all the final version,
# everything is fluid and can be changed
#
# 1. We will need a metadata class for regular tensor, no point forcing it
# into a ShardedTensorMetadata.
#
# 2. This code is using pickle for serialization, we need to replace the
# serialization with something more reasonable e.g. flatbuffer before any
# serious use case.
#
# 3. To get thing moving faster, I am using tensor as the "unit" for read/write
# request. The ideal solution we have is to use a buffer instead. To make a
# decision, we will need to fully understand the performance
# implication for model store
